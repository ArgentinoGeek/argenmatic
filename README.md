## 😷 Overview
Argenmatic is a web-based project that you can use to create a resume or curriculum vitae by dragging and dropping. You don't need to create an account, but it is definitely recommendable so you can use all the features that it provides 😍.

The application is responsive, so you can use it on a PC, tablet, or mobile.

### 🧠 Why?
Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 (coronavirus), many people lost their jobs and the possibility of generating income. There are many people who have never been able to create their own resumes in an easy and simple way. That is why this tool is intended to create a web application that can help everyone to create their resume in the easiest and fastest way possible.

## 🤓 Features
### 😮 If you don't have an account, you can:
- Create a resume by dragging and dropping elements.
- Choose a prebuilt template and use it as a start point.
- Download your generated resume in different formats (PDF, HTML, Word, or TXT).
- Your information is not going to be saved anywhere.

### 😎 If you have an account, you can:
- Use all the previously mentioned features.
- Save your resumes as a draft or as a public resume into a specific category.
- Download them anytime in any format.
- Send the resume to a specific email.
- Link your LinkedIn account to import your information and receive updated information when you do this on LinkedIn 🤖 (if you get a new position it will be synchronized automatically).
- Create prebuilt templates.
- Vote for your favorite templates, as well as saving them into your favorite templates list.
- You will have a public profile (with a unique URL) that you can share anywhere.

### 🧐 If you are a recruiter (and you are also registered as it), you can:
- Filter resumes by category and language.
- View contact information for public profiles.
- Contact a person using an In-Mail option (this will send an Email to the person)
- Save custom messages that you can use to contact a person (with variables!)
- Rate the profile, so any other recruiter can see what do you think of this person.
